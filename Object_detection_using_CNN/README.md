# Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
The dataset contains small color images belonging to 10 different object categories.

## Dataset
- Loaded using `datasets.cifar10.load_data()`
- Classes include airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks

## Approach
- Image normalization
- CNN architecture design
- Model training and evaluation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Model
- Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Input: 32×32 RGB images
- Output: 10 object classes

## Key Learnings
- Convolution and pooling operations
- Image feature extraction
- Deep learning workflow for vision tasks

## Use Case
Foundation for advanced computer vision tasks such as object detection and image recognition systems.
