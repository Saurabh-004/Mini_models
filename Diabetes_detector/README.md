# Diabetes Prediction in Women

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in women using medical diagnostic features.  
The goal is to assist in early risk detection using machine learning.

## Dataset Features
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Training using **ensemble learning methods**
- Model comparison to improve prediction stability

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib

## Models Used
- Ensemble techniques (e.g. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

## Key Learnings
- Medical data preprocessing
- Feature importance analysis
- Ensemble model advantages over single estimators

## Use Case
Can be used as a decision-support tool for healthcare analytics (not a medical diagnosis replacement).
