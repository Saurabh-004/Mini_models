# Mail Spam Detector

## Overview
This project is a machine learning based email spam detection system.  
It classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using text representation and probabilistic modeling.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using **Bag of Words**
- Model training using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- pandas

## Model
- Algorithm: MultinomialNB
- Input: Raw email text
- Output: Spam / Not Spam

## Key Learnings
- Text vectorization using Bag of Words
- Probabilistic classification
- Handling sparse text data

## Use Case
Can be extended to real-world email filtering systems or integrated into messaging platforms.
